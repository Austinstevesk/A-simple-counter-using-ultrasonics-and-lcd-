# A-simple-counter-using-ultrasonics-and-lcd-
In this project, two ultrasonics and lcds were used, the first ultrasonic was supposed to detect someone getting in and the second one confirms and increments the count value. Consequently, as the person/object gets out, the first counter detects about them going out and the second one confirms and decrements the count value.
